We track our time spent working issues in Jira, but its difficult to pull "time spent" data back out - outside of the built-in reports and tools.

You could dump your Jira queries to Excel and work with the data there, but if
1. You just want to total the time spent,
2. On a list of issues returned by a query

If you have ScriptRunner installed in your Jira instance, there is an easier way....

Let's say you want to know all the time spent on your assigned issues for a project.  A simple query shows all of the tickets in the Epic that were assigned to me.

Using the issueFunction "aggregateExpression" you can quickly grab the total time spent on issues in that query.

{% highlight sql %}
"Epic Link" = MYPROJ-5021 AND assignee = currentUser() AND  issueFunction in aggregateExpression("Total tracked", "timespent.sum()")
{% endhighlight %}

Which returns the sum of timespent at the top of the search results
